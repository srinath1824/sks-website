      fullQuote: 'Anjali, a Sadhak from Bangalore, was heartbroken when her son was diagnosed with a speech delay disorder. Despite visiting top hospitals and specialists, she was told there was no medical cure. Guided to explore holistic healing, she came across a video of a miraculous recovery‚Äîwhere a child with a hole in the heart (ASD) was healed by the divine grace of Parama Pujya Sree Jeeveswara Yogi. Inspired, Anjali joined the SKS Level 1 course and later attended the Kalpataru session by Pujya Gurudev‚Äîrenowned as the fastest and safest healing and manifestation technique. With deep faith, she applied the technique to her son. In just 3 days, to her astonishment, he spoke his first words: "ball," "bat," and "cat." After 8 months of despair, she finally witnessed a miracle. With heartfelt gratitude, she says: "I am forever indebted to Gurudev and surrender my life at HIS feet."',
